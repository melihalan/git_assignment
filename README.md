> a. What is an _issue_?

Issues are used to track todos, bugs, feature requests, and more. They're used to discuss features and match with relevant pull requests.

> b. What is a _pull request_?

Once changes are ready to be merged to the "main" branch a pull request should be created to make sure that the changes are approved before hand.

> c. How do I open up a _pull request_?

When you're finished doing all the changes you made push them to remote, you go to the pull requests tab in Github and click new pull request select main on the left side and the new branch you worked on on the right and hit craete pull request. Same way you can go to any public repo and visit pull request tab to find out more on the pull request details.

> d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.

In your repo, click settings, click collaborators on the left, click add people and send them an invite.

> e. What is the difference between `git` and `GitHub`?

git is a version control system, GitHub is a service provider to run git related tasks in the cloud and make collaboration easier with extra features.

> f. What does `git diff` do?

Show changes between different branches.

> g. What is the `main` branch?

"main" or "master" branch is the main branch where all of the production code is hosted, we should branch off of the main branch and merge back into it once development completes. 

> h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the `main` branch?

No, we should create a new branch called development etc. and use that until we are sure that our code is working and depending on the scheduling of features or tasks every time we finish off something new we should create and merge pull requests after review.
