    > a. What is an _issue_?
    Issues are used to track todos, bugs, feature requests, and more. They're used to discuss features and match with relevant pull requests.
    > b. What is a _pull request_?
    Once changes are ready to be merged to the "main" branch a pull request should be created to make sure that the changes are approved before hand.
